/// Enum with the different attributes to style your test.
///
/// There are few things to note:
/// - Not all attributes are supported, some of them are only supported on Windows some only on Unix,
/// and some are only very rarely supported.
/// - I got those attributes, descriptions, supportability from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_(Select_Graphic_Rendition)_parameters
/// - Take note of the fact that when running your program cross-platform that some attributes might not work because of their support.
/// - When an attribute is not supported nothing will happen with the terminal state.
///
/// # Example
/// You can use an attribute in a write statement to apply the attribute to the terminal output.
///
/// ```ignore
/// println!(
///     "{} Underlined {} No Underline",
///     Attribute::Underlined,
///     Attribute::NoUnderline
/// );
/// ```
///
/// You can also call attribute functions on a `&'static str`:
/// ```ignore
/// use Colorizer;
///
/// println!("{}", style("Bold text").bold());
/// println!("{}", style("Underlined text").underlined());
/// println!("{}", style("Negative text").negative());
/// ```
